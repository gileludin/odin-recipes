        <h1>Pork Fried Rice</h1>

        <h2>Descripton</h2>
        <p>
          A great recipe for leftover pork chops, roasts, and more. A few bits
          from the fridge turn into a tasty dinner in less than 45 minutes. If I
          have a leftover grilled pork or the tail of a roast, I'll freeze it
          until I have enough for this dish. You can also use chicken or
          substitute some of the veggies for what you have on hand when cleaning
          out the fridge. Serve with sweet Thai chili sauce on the side.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook
            and stir mushrooms until liquid has evaporated, and mushrooms are
            browned, about 15 minutes. Set mushrooms aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fluff cooked rice with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
            to separate the grains. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok
            over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, garlic, and ginger until
            fragrant, about 1 minute. Add celery, onion, and carrot. Cook and
            stir until vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in bell
            pepper and cooked mushrooms just until combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in cooked rice, lightly tossing until rice is heated through and
            thoroughly combined with pork and vegetables. Stir in soy sauce,
            remove from heat, and sprinkle green onions over the top.
          </li>
