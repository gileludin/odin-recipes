    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>
      A great recipe for leftover pork chops, roasts, and more. A few bits from
      the fridge turn into a tasty dinner in less than 45 minutes. If I have a
      leftover grilled pork or the tail of a roast, I'll freeze it until I have
      enough for this dish. You can also use chicken or substitute some of the
      veggies for what you have on hand when cleaning out the fridge. Serve with
      sweet Thai chili sauce on the side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>6 cups cooled cooked rice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups cubed cooked pork</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 large carrot, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 green onions, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and
        stir mushrooms until liquid has evaporated, and mushrooms are browned,
        about 15 minutes. Set mushrooms aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluff cooked rice with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to
        separate the grains. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok
        over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, garlic, and ginger until fragrant,
        about 1 minute. Add celery, onion, and carrot. Cook and stir until
        vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in bell pepper and
        cooked mushrooms just until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in cooked rice, lightly tossing until rice is heated through and
        thoroughly combined with pork and vegetables. Stir in soy sauce, remove
        from heat, and sprinkle green onions over the top.
      </li>
